# Marketing Agency Code Refactor

Cleaning up code is an important skill as it helps improve access and readability. When code is restructured, the aim is to have no impact on the external behaviour and functionality. This is know as Code Refactoring.

In this example, I have used semantic HTML elements to separate sections of a webpage, making the code much easier to navigate. Both the HTML and CSS files have been refactored. I have also included detailed comments to help users identify each section easily.
